## Introduction

This project was created to fulfill a requirement for [Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program. Udacity provided [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) for the project which contained the game engine and visual assets. Students were asked to use object-oriented JavaScript to create a working game that fulfilled the project rubric. 

### Rubric Specifications
* Player cannot move off screen
* Vehicles cross the screen
* Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
* Vehicle-player collision resets the game
* Something happens when player wins
* Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features

### Bonus Additions
* Scoring system
* Lives counter
* Game over modal

## Acknowledgments
Along with learning from [Udacity's Object Oriented JavaScript course](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud711), I also gained knowledge in object-oriented JavaScript through reviewing [Chapter 6: The Secret Life of Objects](https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html) from Marijn Haverbeke's “Eloquent JavaScript.”

[Rodrick Bloomfield](https://github.com/bloom305) provided a helpful [webinar session](https://zoom.us/recording/play/aulotDlzKFegQFIJTaTzKgWvNkVsYtlwO454vL1UPE1Cm6lOUBQCtfVurPOIAGAS?startTime=1529542978000) on getting started on the project, and [Matthew Cranford](https://matthewcranford.com/) has an excellent [blog series](https://matthewcranford.com/arcade-game-walkthrough-part-1-starter-code-breakdown/) breaking down the project in six parts.
